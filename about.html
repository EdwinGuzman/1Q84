					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>I love music. </p>
					<p>When I was younger, I highly enjoyed the music from cartoons.  I was deeply fascinated
					by how the music went so well with the cartoons and how it conveyed such deep emotions.</p>
					<p>For example, in <a href='http://youtu.be/EDQLy84ad04' target="_blank">Bugs Bunny's Rabbit
					of Seville</a>, at the 3:40 mark, the music parallel's Elmer Fudd's anger and then it just keeps
					escalating.  I also enjoyed Tom and Jerry's <a href="http://youtu.be/MRxB4mFXAQA" target="_blank">
					The Cat Above and The Mouse Below</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/6NXo7pr8iRM" target="_blank">
					The Cat Concerto</a>.  To this day, I still listen to the music that those cartoons were all based on.</p>
					<p>How does this tie in with Haruki Murakami's 1Q84 novel?  I also use to watch Ren & Stimpy and there was one
					specific song I liked but I never learned the name of.  It wasn't until many years later when I read 
					The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, also by Murakami, that I learned about the song <a href="http://youtu.be/uYxfI2Hj7_0"
					target="_blank">La Gazza Ladra (The Thieving Magpie)</a> by 
					Gioachino Rossini.  Not recognizing the song, I decided to give a listen to it and lo and behold, it 
					was the song from Ren & Stimpy!</p>
					<p>Thus came my attempt to list down all the songs as they appear in Haruki Murakami's novel 1Q84.  To set
					the mood for the novel, to listen to new music, and to have a single place to listen to all the music.  
					Also, if you hover over a song, you'll get to see in what context the song was mentioned.</p>
					<p>NOTE: I do not own any of the music.  All the music was queried through YouTube's Data API.  All the quotes 
					that pop-up when you hover over a song are from Haruki Murakami's novel 1Q84, which was the inspiration for this 
					project as well.</p>
